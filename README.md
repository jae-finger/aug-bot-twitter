# Project Summary
This repo houses a pet project of mine. In essence, I am building a twitter bot that tweets out facts about my dog every once in a while.


## Project Outline
* A python bot that monitors the time
* When a certain time has passed, activate a tweet script
* The tweet script, when activated, randomly selects a fact to tweet


## Project Future
* Add images and many more facts to tweet about Augie
* Add facts, images, * tweets to a database
* Have the databse keep track of how many times and when the facts were tweeted
* Add in a scan to check if users commented, and if so, reply to the comment
